    <h3 id="heading">TIMELINE OF BHAGAT SINGH'S LIFE</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>1907</strong> - Bhagat Singh, a Sandhu Jat, was born to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati at Chak No. 105 GB, Banga village, Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India present day Pakistan. </li>
      
      <li> <strong>1919</strong> - When he was 12 years old, Singh visited the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre hours after thousands of unarmed people gathered at a public meeting had been killed. </li>
      
      <li> <strong>1921</strong> -  He was among those in his village who welcomed protesters against the killing of a large number of unarmed people at Gurudwara Nankana Sahib on 20 February. </li>
      
      <li> <strong>1923</strong> - Singh joined the National College in Lahore, where he also participated in extra-curricular activities like the dramatics society and won an essay competition set by the Punjab Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, writing on the problems in the Punjab. </li>
      
      <li> <strong>1926</strong> - He founded the Indian socialist youth organisation Naujawan Bharat Sabha in March. He also joined the Hindustan Republican Association, which had prominent leaders, such as Chandrashekhar Azad, Ram Prasad Bismil and Shahid Ashfaqallah Khan. </li>
      
      <li> <strong>1927</strong> - Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. </li>
      
      <li> <strong>1928</strong> - Bhagat was a prominent member of the HRA and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to HSRA. The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad and kill Scott. However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December. </li>
      
      <li> <strong>1929</strong> - He proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims. On 8 April, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery while it was in session. The two men were arrested and subsequently moved through a series of jails in Delhi. </li>
      
      <li> <strong>1931</strong> - Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931. The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail. </li>
    </ul>
